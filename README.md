# ElectroStorm - Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance & Line Detection Robot

![ElectroStorm Bot](https://your-image-link.com)  
*An intelligent Arduino-powered robot for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.*

## 🚀 Project Overview
ElectroStorm is an **autonomous mobile robot** that navigates its environment by avoiding obstacles and detecting black lines. It utilizes an **ultrasonic sensor** for distance measurement, an **IR sensor** for black line detection, and a **servo motor** to scan for alternative paths when obstacles are encountered. The robot is controlled via an **Arduino Uno**, with an LCD screen for real-time status updates.

## 🔥 Features
- **Obstacle Detection & Avoidance** – Uses an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to detect objects and navigate accordingly.
- **Line Detection** – An **IR sensor** identifies black lines and stops movement.
- **Servo-Based Path Scanning** – The **SG90 servo motor** scans left and right for alternative paths.
- **LCD Status Display** – A **16x2 I2C LCD** provides real-time feedback.
- **Button-Controlled Start** – Ensures the bot moves only when activated.
